- **Inbuilt Widgets**: Start with `TextWidget` for easy text display and expand with more specialized widgets.
- **Utility Classes**: Utilize `DrawHelper`, `ColorHelper`, and `TextureHelper` for efficient and streamlined development.
- **ContextMenu**: A versatile context menu featuring boolean, slider, runnable, color options, and list/enum selections for comprehensive widget customization.
- **Screen Border Control**: Widgets are confined within the screen boundaries to prevent off-screen drift.
- **Snapping**: Widgets automatically snap to a grid corner in a imaginary grid pattern on the screen when the shift key is pressed.

- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup for quick implementation into your projects.

## Disclaimer
DynamicHUD is a library for Minecraft Fabric designed to provide developers with the tools to create customizable HUD elements. It does not add widgets or any functionality on its own. Interaction with DynamicHUD's internals and utilization of its features can only be done through mods that implement this library. Users looking for in-game HUD elements should refer to mods that use DynamicHUD.

*_This mod / library is fabric only and has no future plans to be ported to forge._*

## Installation for Users

To ensure mods that depend on DynamicHUD work correctly, follow these steps to add DynamicHUD to your Minecraft installation:

0. Make sure you have [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and [Fabric-API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/) installed.
1. Download the `dynamichud-<version>.jar` file from the official [release](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamichud/versions) page.
2. Navigate to your Minecraft directory. The default path is usually:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\.minecraft`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`

3. Locate the `mods` folder within your Minecraft directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
4. Place the downloaded DynamicHUD `.jar` file into the `mods` folder.
5. Run Minecraft with the Fabric loader. DynamicHUD will now be loaded, and any mods with DynamicHUD as a dependency can function properly.
