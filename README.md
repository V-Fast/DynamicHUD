A library to create Hud elements and display them on the screen. Fabric only

Current version: 0.0.0.01

Dont look at the code. I warn you.

Library not arranged, viewer discretion warned

## [DynamicHUDmod.java](src/main/java/net/dynamichud/dynamichud/DynamicHUDmod.java) and [MoveScreen.java](src/main/java/net/dynamichud/dynamichud/hudscreen/MoveScreen.java) are two examples. 

### [DynamicHUDmod.java](src/main/java/net/dynamichud/dynamichud/DynamicHUDmod.java) will be removed in later updates as it is currently only used for testing purposes.

### [MoveScreen.java](src/main/java/net/dynamichud/dynamichud/hudscreen/MoveScreen.java) will stay in the library since it can be used directly.


TODO:
-[] Save and load of widgets. Make that compatible with any widget.
-[] Since this library is in testing phase, most of the methods are one way use, which means only the library can use them, and these methods are quite important for devlopers using this library. Make this methods open to all
-[] Add more features and draw and helpers.
